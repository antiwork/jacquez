### 3. GitHub App Setup

     - Contents: Read (for loading CONTRIBUTING.md)
   - **Subscribe to events**:
     - Issues

- **Smee.io Channel**: Create at https://smee.io/

## Running the Server

### Development Mode

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 and display:

```
GitHub App server is running on port 3000
Webhook URL: http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

### Production Mode

For production deployment, ensure environment variables are set and run:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## How It Works

Jacquez operates as a **GitHub App** that:

1. **Posts helpful comments** on issues and PRs when guidelines are violated
2. **Optionally triggers CI validation** to fail builds for stricter enforcement

### Features

- üí¨ **Comment-based guidance** - Helps contributors understand requirements
- ‚ùå **Optional CI enforcement** - Can fail builds to prevent merging violations
- ü§ñ **Handles multiple events** - Works on issues, PRs, and comments
- üìñ **Guideline integration** - Uses your repository's CONTRIBUTING.md file

### Setup Options

- **Basic setup**: Install the GitHub App for comment-based guidance
- **Enhanced enforcement**: Add the validation workflow to trigger CI checks

## Testing

### Local Testing with Smee.io

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. In another terminal, forward webhooks from Smee.io:
   ```bash
   npx smee-client --url https://smee.io/your_channel_id --path /webhook --port 3000
   ```
3. Test by:
   - Opening an issue in a repository where your app is installed
   - Opening a pull request
   - Commenting on an issue
